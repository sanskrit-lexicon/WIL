step2a

Add L-codes (wil.xml record identifiers) to wil_mw.txt and
wil_mw_prob.txt.  This involves modification to wil_mw.py.

Use inputs from step2 folder.

python wil_mw.py ../step2/wil_rdot.txt ../step2/verb_step0a.txt wil_mw.txt wil_mw_prob.txt > wil_mw_log.txt


Each line of output wil_mw.txt now has a field <wilL>X</wilL>  with the L-number of the Wilson root, 
and a field <mwL>Y</mwL> for the L-number of the corresponding MW root.

One interesting feature of <mwL>Y</mwL> is that there may be more than one MW L-number represented by Y.
For example:

<c>SPa-ROOT</c> <wil>aWa</wil> <mw>aW</mw> <wilL>642</wilL> <mwL>2383,2447.1</mwL>
Thus there is uncertainty as to which of the two MW records Wilson's root aW corresponds.  In this
case an examination of the entries in MW shows that in the second reference (2447.1), aW is given as
an alternate spelling to aRW;  And Wilson's entry for aW has forms both with and without a nasal.
May not matter much which of the two MW records the single WIL record corresponds.


This phenomenon  (searchable by records in wil_mw.txt containing a comma) occurs 191 times.
